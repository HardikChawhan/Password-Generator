# Password Generator App
This is a [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).
That allows users to generate secure passwords based on specified criteria. Users can choose the length and types of characters to include, such as uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. The app also features a user-friendly interface with animated checkboxes and the ability to copy generated passwords to the clipboard.

## Libraries Used

- [Yup](https://github.com/jquense/yup): Used for form validation schema to ensure the password length adheres to specified rules. (also printing the error messages is super easy with the help of this library)
- [Formik](https://github.com/jaredpalmer/formik): Utilized to manage the form state and handle form submission efficiently.
- [react-native-bouncy-checkbox](https://github.com/WrathChaos/react-native-bouncy-checkbox): Provides an animated checkbox component that enhances the user experience.

## Clipboard API

>**Note**: The app uses the `Clipboard` API (deprecated in React Native) directly instead of [@react-native-community/Clipboard](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@react-native-community/clipboard) library because the `setString()` method in the community version was throwing an error. You can find more details about the issue [here](https://github.com/react-native-clipboard/clipboard/issues/71).

# Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

## Step 3: Modifying your App

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's modify it.

1. Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and edit some lines.
2. For **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Developer Menu** (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on Window and Linux) or <kbd>Cmd âŒ˜</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on macOS)) to see your changes!

   For **iOS**: Hit <kbd>Cmd âŒ˜</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> in your iOS Simulator to reload the app and see your changes!

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:
